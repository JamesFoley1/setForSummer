Set for Summer aims to connect low-income & underprivileged youth to resources that they may lack during the Summer break
from school. 
While most kids look forward to the break from class and homework, many low-income parents have tough obstacles to face; ranging from costs of adequate daycare to simply providing food three times a day.
We bring the specific resources together in one place so that families, teachers, and organizations can find the help they
need to care for their children and ensure all have a great Summer
